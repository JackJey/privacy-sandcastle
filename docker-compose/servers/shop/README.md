### Basic Architecture

It builds upon basic next.js manner.

- Each pages components are under `./pages` and API endpoints are `./pages/api`
- It's fully SPA but each pages are SSRed.
- Frontend states are managed by `useContext` and updated by `useReducer`.
- Server states (session) are managed by `iron-session`.
  - no session storage on server side, every session are serialized/encrypted in cookie directory.
  - server states will be initialState for react context while SSR.
- Every CSS are styled via tailwind.
- Item information's are encoded in `lib/items.ts`, so no databases in this app.
